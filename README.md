---------------------
*By James Walker. Public-domain software under the Unlicense.*

This project contains a Sass mixin to enable responsive property value scaling based on viewport values.

The mixin allows you to define a floor and ceiling to limit the minimum and maximum values of any given property.

Between the floor and ceiling, the value is automatically scaledaccording to a given viewport unit.
